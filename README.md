# BondAmortization_VBA
Currently I am preparing myself for the Financial Mathematics (FM) exam which is part of the preliminary series of actuarial exam. Excel is the hero that is adeptly shouldering the weight of intricate financial computations. So while doing the calculations, I thought why not see them come to life within the realm of Excel. I believe, regardless of exam outcomes, acquiring Excel prowess is a valuable asset for anyone embarking on a journey into the financial arena. 
The FM exam includes questions on bond valuation. Candidates are expected to calculate bond prices, yields, and assess the impact of changes in market conditions on bond values. In this post, I will create a simple bond amortization schedule using the Excel VBA code. I created this project to solidify my understanding of bond valuation. By coding my own bond valuation calculator, I could better visualize the impact of different variables on bond prices.
